# Sound Files for Truth Detector Quiz

This directory should contain the following 8-bit sound effect files:

1. `start.mp3` - Sound played when starting the quiz
2. `click.mp3` - Sound played when clicking buttons
3. `correct.mp3` - Sound played for correct answers
4. `wrong.mp3` - Sound played for incorrect answers
5. `success.mp3` - Sound played when completing the quiz
6. `leaderboard.mp3` - Sound played when viewing the leaderboard

## Note on Browser Audio Playback

Modern browsers require user interaction before allowing audio to play automatically. 
This is why some sounds might not play on initial page load.

## Sound Sources

You can find free 8-bit sound effects on sites like:
- Freesound.org
- OpenGameArt.org
- BFXR (a tool to generate your own retro game sounds)

## Important: Sound Files Are Optional

The application is designed to work without sound files. If sound files are not available,
the application will continue to function normally without audio feedback.
